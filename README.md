- 👋 Hi, I’m @Danalysts
- 👀 I’m interested in automating anything that can be, including repetative tasks as well as less frequent detail oriented work.  Also interested in privacy and security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning time data manipulation and event recognition in python, as well as databasing in SQL, and automating reports with Power Query.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: danalyst@tuta.io
